# Political blogs in the US, the 2004 elections.
This project uses social network analysis basics to understand and underline the main consequences and implications of political blogs communications and references during the US 2004 election campaign.
A small-world social network of more than 20000 political blogs is analyzed; Blogs either support republicans or democrats, although in our analysis we assumed no membership to carefully judge without bias.
